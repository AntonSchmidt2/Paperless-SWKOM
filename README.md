# Paperless-SWKOM

* The Paperless UI files are seperate from the web server - both therefore have their own dockerfiles
* The compose.yaml file should compose both containers

* Due to vague sprint requirements I included this implementation also, depending on future instructions either this or the original sprint-release-2 branch will be used further
